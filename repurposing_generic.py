  inputs=["Sure,\n  it\'s a nice beach, but I maybe expected more. We had to pay $35 for parking\n and then saw that we probably could have found street parking and walked. If\n  you plan to swim and use the beach, it\'s probably good for that, but not\n  worth the parking cost it if just passing through."

  "Sandy\n  white beaches!!! Clean and free of trash these beaches are always an amazing\n  experience. The water is gorgeous and often times you have nice sand bars\n  that allow you to go out further. This time around we had many manta rays\n  swimming around which adds to the beauty. A must see!"

  "Twice\n  we drove all the way down to the coast and bought hotel rooms for multiple\n  nights hoping to see one of the turtle releases and twice the National\n  Seashore underachieved.\n    The beach is beautiful however I am incredibly disappointed in the turtle\n  release program they have! They state on their website to plan your trip\n  around the time the most turtles are expected to hatch.\n    My family and I went down to the coast to watch the turtles hatch.... Well\n  you can imagine our disappointment when no public releases happened.\n    We later found out that the turtles did hatch they simply didnâ€™t want to\n  host a PUBLIC release even though we planned for the dates that coincided\n  with the release dates on their website."],

    Example("Most\n  people turn at the Navarre Beach sign and drive straight to the beach.\n  However, it is a long walk to the pier and a long walk to the water. If you\n  don\'t want a long walk to the beach, drive a few minutes west and look for\n  area 29, 32, or 33. We went in August. If you are looking for a relaxing ,\n  family beach, this is it!", "positive"), 
    Example("Gorgeous\n  beach. Navarre is beautiful and the sand is super soft. Itâ€™s a clean beach\n  and very family friendly which is awesome. Itâ€™s also nice that there isnâ€™t\n  much built up around it but maybe 4 condos/ 1 hotel. The only downside was\n  the lack of good restaurants. The food across the board was average and lots\n  of fried food but healthy options were tough to find. This is definitely a\n  beach only destination which is completely fine by me. I love that there\n  arenâ€™t beach superstores, chains everywhere next to the beach. I love that\n  itâ€™s more quiet than the really populated beaches like Panama City Beach,\n  Miami, Daytona, etc. Go with Navarre or the beaches down south if youâ€™re\n  looking for a more relaxed spot", "positive"), Example("Nice Long\n  Beach, with good drive on access points.

All I\n  saw was Midwestern tourists wearing trucker hats and screaming at their kids\n  and each other. Maybe it\'s great for families- but as a solo traveler, this\n  place actually disturbed my peace! I made a special trip south to see it, and\n  lasted maybe 40 mins before I HAD TO leave.

I was turned back because the park is full but\n  this review is about how difficult and perhaps dangerous entering the park\n  from HW1. First it is a very sharp turn with no easy way to see any car\n  coming out when you turn into the park entrance. Second it is a steep decline\n  going down after the turn. So for someone not familiar with driving on a\n  slope, this is not a comfortable place to visit. Getting out is almost as bad\n  if multiple cars got trapped on the way up the slope.

    Example("The beach\n  is gorgeous: incredible white powdery sand, nice landscaping with low\n  buildings and miles and miles of beaches to enjoy (when that\'s possible). We\n  visited this beach from October 6th to October 8th (when we had to leave due\n  to Hurricane Michael) and red tide was horrible. You could only stay at the\n  beach (or near it) very early in the morning to avoid coughing; then, when\n  the wind direction changed, it all started again: cough, runny nose, scratchy\n  throats and hundreds of dead fish on the sand: what a terrible pity!!! A\n  pity, yes, for visitors, for the fauna, for locals!!!! I know red tide is\n  supposed to be a natural phenomenon, but is it really so??? Can\'t there be\n  some other human-made factor boosting it??? I talked to a man who owns a house\n  on the beach, and he said he had never seen such a terrible red tide in the\n  twenty years he\'s owned his house. So...I believe it\'s time for everybody to\n  think what kind of planet we want to live in, and act in consequence, or we\n  run the risk of seeing this kind of event (and many others)more often!! To\n  sum up, Santa Rosa Beach is an awesome beach, which we couldn\'t enjoy due to\n  red tide! (Of course, no swimming at all!)", "neutral")])
