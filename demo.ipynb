They state on their website to plan your trip around the time the most turtles are expected to hatch.\\nMy family and I went down to the coast to watch the turtles hatch.... Well you can imagine our disappointment when no public releases happened.\\nWe later found out that the turtles did hatch they simply didn�t want to host a PUBLIC release even though we planned for the dates that coincided with the release dates on their website. \n",

It's just sad that there's so much pollution. Some people didn't seem to mind the trash, though. There is a ten dollar entrance fee. The park website says that the trash situation is better at different times if the year. The drive out there is very pretty and scenic with nice dunes. \n",

      " RV camped here with 2yr and 8 yr olds. Very nice bath house. RV spot was no nonsense with a pergola over a picnic table and a grill out in the sun. Too hot to grill. When they say the RV spots are just behind the sand dunes from the beach they mean half a mile or so walk to the beach. There are a few picnic tables with pergolas on the beach. This part of the gulf gets sea grasses and other things washed up on shore and the water is pretty murky. \n",

      " Heaven on Earth! I love it here. My fam would prob give it 4 stars for no shade except at the picnic tables when you walk in near the lifeguard tower but I love this beach. Long 2 miles of beautiful and wide white sandy beach. Sandy bottom and great to cool off relax and float. Great places where there was calm and places for boogie boards or learning how to surf. The backdrop cannot be compared and it is truly breathtaking. They were redoing the bathrooms when we visited so just port a potties. 2 showers. 10 min walk to shops and restaurants if you�re near the middle of the beach. We wished you could rent SUPs on the beach but I think they�re near the street rather than beach front? \n",
