"Really nice easy going beach, great for runs, walks, swimming & sun bathing. right beside all amenities you need.",neutral,
"This beach isn�t very deep, from the street to the water, but it was ok. The sand is a bit coarse and the beach was quite full, considering it�s smallish size, but people were respectful of one another�s space. We walked the beach for a few miles and it never got much larger or better. There are several restaurants on the beach�s edge, many were quite expensive and/or loud.

"Saw there were going to be decent waves this weekend so brought my boards to the beach for some boogie boarding. When I parked I noticed the flags was 1 red not 2 red, 2 red means water is closed to public one red means high surf, swimming is discouraged but allowed. The life guard told me I couldn't go in the water unless if I had fins which is ridiculous fins help but are not required. Don't waste your money here. I've been boogie boarding for 20 years I follow the flags rules, Im aware of how rip currents work and am mindful.",negative,

It is so sad that such a nice beach is associated with utterly disgraceful locale with so few parking.,negative,
We walked along the beach for a bit. No public bathrooms to be seen. Wouldn't be able to stay very long.,neutral,
Was very disappointed because while the beaches were beautiful. There are no public facilities for changing or bathrooms at all at least on the mile or so we traveled. Unless you stay at a hotel nearby sort of stuck. Plan ahead if you go to the beach. They are beautiful just limited. Was really surprised having been to Miami Beach and south Miami Beach which does have public facilities on the public beaches.,neutral,
"I understand that this is a popular beach. But I have to review what I experienced. We were there on two pretty windy days. The surf was rough and the trash was everywhere. We saw multiple syringes in the sand. Made for walking around a bit concerning. The purple flag was out and we found tons of jellyfish beached. I'm sure this is a normally nice beach, but not on the days we were there.",neutral,
"VERY disappointing hotel...everyone there experiencing the awful elevator debacle that, we�ve been told a has been ongoing since at least July. Two of four elevators � worked� and I say that facetiously because half of the time those two acted up, leaving guests waiting for anywhere from 5 minutes to 10-15 often. With 14 floors, this became a big problem. The hotel workers� service elevator was broken so there they are trying to board with guests...not their fault. They should all standup and walk out. The ice machine on our floor and the next up were broken the entire time we were there from 25th-30th. Scuba diving and life saving classes going on IN THE MAIN POOL the first three mornings we were there...very annoying and we told them that should be held BEFORE the pool opens. The",neutral,
Traffic on 399 East (Gulf Blvd) is just horrible because of the 3 way stop sign. This intersection probably needs a traffic light as Navarre beach is grown more busy every year. This place may could of gotten away with a 3 way stop sign 5 years ago. But It definitely can�t anymore. The wider bridge would also help. Traffic from Navarre Pkwy to the 399 bridge is just as bad if not worse. This place definitely needs some new traffic help with the up rise in the crowds to Navarre.\nYour almost better off in taking Navarre Pkwy all the way down to Pensacola Beach Rd and coming Navarre from the back way. The beach is now always packed. I remember coming here during the peak July months and the roadways would be clear.\nI was here in the beginning of May and it was just slammed!\nNavarre Beach,neutral,

We loved this beach. Quiet and gorgeous. The pier is great!! Waters can be still one day and large waves the next. Will be back,positive,
"Most people turn at the Navarre Beach sign and drive straight to the beach. However, it is a long walk to the pier and a long walk to the water. If you don't want a long walk to the beach, drive a few minutes west and look for area 29, 32, or 33. We went in August. If you are looking for a relaxing , family beach, this is it!",positive,
"Gorgeous beach. Navarre is beautiful and the sand is super soft. It�s a clean beach and very family friendly which is awesome. It�s also nice that there isn�t much built up around it but maybe 4 condos/ 1 hotel. The only downside was the lack of good restaurants. The food across the board was average and lots of fried food but healthy options were tough to find. This is definitely a beach only destination which is completely fine by me. I love that there aren�t beach superstores, chains everywhere next to the beach. I love that it�s more quiet than the really populated beaches like Panama City Beach, Miami, Daytona, etc. Go with Navarre or the beaches down south if you�re looking for a more relaxed spot",positive,
Quiet and peaceful beach and mostly clean sand though it seemed to have more cigarette butts than the beach at Destin Florida when we visited.,positive,
"This is our second time back to Navarre beach due to it�s beautiful sand and water. Unfortunately, we came after a tropical storm that stirred up a lot of algae. The water was not as clear as usual and I needed a shower afterwards to clean off all the green. Otherwise, the experience was still good. It is a family friendly atmosphere. Be sure to wear sunscreen and reapply often.",positive,
"It was our family's second time going to the Tennessee Aquarium and this time was average. I understand that this pandemic has messed up some things, but it just was not as fun as the first time. It seemed like a lot of exhibits were missing. It only took us 45 minutes to an hour to finish the whole thing.",neutral,
"Cute place but tour is lacking. They simply give you a card that Has labels of what you are looking at in distillery. Then you sample three drinks : gin&tonic, mule, and whiskey. Sample are great and people are very friendly. They are doing their best with covid environment. It is not really a tour anymore. The restaurant next door is good.",negative,
"This was our second tour of the distillery and truly disappointing. Our tour guide truly did his best, but the obnoxious people just ruined it. Yes, people touring a distillery are going to be a little rowdy. It�s fun, like a little party with some history added in. Sadly, these folks could not shut up so that a word could be heard. On our last tour, there were very thorough descriptions of how the drinks were mixed, the stories behind the mixers and a visual of the drinks being prepared with a discussion. Not so this time, who could have heard it? It was basically just pour a bunch of tiny drinks, come crushing in to get them. One young man just stood there in front of everyone handing drinks back to his crew of people and nearly got into an altercation with another man. It was largely ",negative,
"Tours are free, but they fill up fast since distilleries are the new hip thing to visit. The building is historic and cool and I give props to their marketing team- they�ve really done a great job in generating interest. However, the gift shop and tasting room get packed. I thought the products were a little overpriced for what you get. I really wasn�t a fan of the rum, vodka, gin or bourbon...but their mixers were pretty cool.",negative,
"You have to time the tickets right, and we missed the window so had to wait a bit. The bourbon mash in the tanks smells great, and we ended up buying a pair of the mixers they sampled. Worth a visit, especially if you get a full size cocktail and something to eat at the Ice Plant restaurant next door.",negative,
"We turned up with our drivers license for id, but was told we needed to bring our passports due to 'Florida law'. We stuck with the tour which was good but were made to feel a bit stupid stuck at the back and not allowed to participate in the tasting, which involved a tiny thimble-full of cocktail. It completely ruined what would have been a good tour.\nNone of this would have been quite so bad-a law is a law, until at the end when I asked if I could still buy some bourbon with just my drivers license, that our guide told us that this so called law is up to discretion, and that I could probably buy a bottle. So basically if I was handing over thirty bucks for a half bottle then mehhhh that's fine.",negative,
Went with a large group of family and friends. The gen eral concensus amongst our group was that there was not much to offer except very expensive drinks and gift shop.,negative,
"Padre Island National Seashore is a nice beach and birding area. The Visitors Center was closed for repairs so we did not see any of the exhibits or have an opportunity to talk with a park ranger.

The viewing tower at the Visitors Center was open and afforded a beautiful view of the seashore and surrounding area.",neutral,
"I live in Pensacola and love Pensacola Beach EXCEPT for Memorial Day Weekend. The island authority promotes this as an LGBT weekend and they get lots of participation from people from all over. The problem is that the island authority values the money from these folks more than they value the family friendly atmosphere that is present on all other days of the year. During this weekend, they apparently allow topless lesbians and nude gay males to walk about freely in some areas. And when the LGBT's finally do go home, they leave their trash wherever they please. The beach is a ridiculous mess at the end of Memorial Day. The authority would not allow other people to do this, but because of the money the weekend brings in, they allow this ridiculous behavior.

"This is a beautiful beach area out from the commercial area. It has great views and the visitor's center has nice picnic tables and a viewing deck. The facilities are not as nice, but there are changing rooms, showers and bathrooms. If you want to spend more than about an hour and a half here, I would recommend packing a cooler and a tent or umbrella to create some shade. When I went on a Friday, the beach was pretty busy, but walking a little bit to one side created some space and was much nicer. I would go here again for the views and the lovely beach area, but I would definitely want to be more prepared next time!",positive,
Gorgeous beach but covered with trash. We drove 15 miles down and there was still trash everywhere that looked like it had been there for quite a while. I would definitely come back but it was very sad to see the state of the exquisite piece of landscape.,positive,
"The view of the shore before every inch was build on. There is a stretch of continues 60 miles of drive-able beach preferably with 4WD vehicle. Part of the beach in front of visitor center is closed for vehicular traffic, offering quiet way to explore this beautiful area.",positive,
This is a disgusting beach. Dirty diapers and empty bottles of beer. The staff is rude and does not speak English,negative,
Major delay to read Seashore. Nature trail access was blocked by road work. Might be great when done but suggest avoiding until it is finished.,negative,
Twice we drove all the way down to the coast and bought hotel rooms for multiple nights hoping to see one of the turtle releases and twice the National Seashore underachieved.\nThe beach is beautiful however I am incredibly disappointed in the turtle release program they have! They state on their website to plan your trip around the time the most turtles are expected to hatch.\nMy family and I went down to the coast to watch the turtles hatch.... Well you can imagine our disappointment when no public releases happened.\nWe later found out that the turtles did hatch they simply didn�t want to host a PUBLIC release even though we planned for the dates that coincided with the release dates on their website.,negative,
"There is a lot of trash on the beach right now. We tried to walk down the beach but we just couldn't ignore the garbage and left after about ten minutes. It's no fault of the park service. It's just sad that there's so much pollution. Some people didn't seem to mind the trash, though. There is a ten dollar entrance fee. The park website says that the trash situation is better at different times if the year. The drive out there is very pretty and scenic with nice dunes.",negative,
RV camped here with 2yr and 8 yr olds. Very nice bath house. RV spot was no nonsense with a pergola over a picnic table and a grill out in the sun. Too hot to grill. When they say the RV spots are just behind the sand dunes from the beach they mean half a mile or so walk to the beach. There are a few picnic tables with pergolas on the beach. This part of the gulf gets sea grasses and other things washed up on shore and the water is pretty murky.,negative,
So...as you drive from Port Aransas there are barriers to keep you from the ocean.It is after\nabout a mile that those barriers go away and then the surf is about 100 yards away..As you drive\n4...5..6 miles you get closer to the waves and as you get within range of Padre Island Seashore\nthe break is very close...This is very cool and raw....The water can have a turquoise color to it but\nyou are not scuba diving anywhere around here,negative,
"The beach seen here is not like the beaches of the Pacific Ocean or Caribbean. The water is from the Gulf of Mexico and is often muddy with smaller waves. It is still the ocean and a great place to enjoy being outdoors, I just wouldn�t travel over 500 miles to it as a destination of choice.",negative,
"Easter Sunday, was not very busy here. Not a whole lot to do. All attractions were a couple of miles away from the beach. Do stop by the pier& walk out on it, for $2.",negative,
Heaven on Earth! I love it here. My fam would prob give it 4 stars for no shade except at the picnic tables when you walk in near the lifeguard tower but I love this beach. Long 2 miles of beautiful and wide white sandy beach. Sandy bottom and great to cool off relax and float. Great places where there was calm and places for boogie boards or learning how to surf. The backdrop cannot be compared and it is truly breathtaking. They were redoing the bathrooms when we visited so just port a potties. 2 showers. 10 min walk to shops and restaurants if you�re near the middle of the beach. We wished you could rent SUPs on the beach but I think they�re near the street rather than beach front?,positive,
We stopped by Hanalei Bay to watch the sunset after dinner. It was very nice. Quite a few others had the same idea. It was a relaxing way to end the day and the sunset was gorgeous.,positive,

"The beach is clean, waves a lil rough for me to swim in but wading and tanning is a for sure. Preferred other beaches.",neutral,
"The town of Hanalei and the adjacent bay are very pretty but crowded and expensive. Difficult to find parking in town and at the beach parking lots. The beach is crowded and the surf is very inconsistent and is either too big and closing out or too small. Everything is very expensive even for Hawaii. People, especially the locals are rude and arrogant. It also rains a lot and there is no night life. Do not recommend coming here. Your money is better spent elsewhere.",negative,
"This is one of Kauai�s best beaches. Excellent swimming, surfing, picnic spot and volley ball. However, even in paradise you find some glitches and this one is becoming largely overwhelmed with too many people and not enough oversight or upkeep. If the city of Hanalei wants to keep this area viable it needs to fix gates, get the dogs out (as posted) stop the extremely loud music and pay attention to one of the loveliest spots on Kauai",negative,
"Probably the most beautiful beach setting in the world. However, people, perhaps locals, let their dogs run wild. Our little part of the beach off of He'e street (Waioli Beach Park) reeked of dog urine and feces. Watched a black lab do its business at waters edge and then it got washed into the surf. Needless to say we didn't go in the water after that. We have been coming to beautiful Hanalei Bay since 2001. Words cannot express our dismay.",negative,

We visited this ~ 7 mile long beach today after passing the unoccupied fee hut. The misting fog kept beachgoers away but there were several tourists like us wanting to see the flowers among the endless dunes of the Cape Cod National Seashore.

Winter is not the best time to go to the beach in Massachusetts but for a peaceful ride without traffic this is a great place to go.,positive,

I had just about given up when some nice guys in a Jeep saw us struggling and offered to take us back to the car. Yes, we saw some seals nearer to the lighthouse. Yes, the beach is pretty big. Yes, there are HUGE sections of that big beach that are cut off for people and left for the birds. It�s a beach. If you go, don�t plan to walk it. The lighthouse was pretty unimpressive and locked. You cans go up it.",neutral,
We made a quick stop here one windy May day and were delighted to see gannets diving for fish. Watched them for awhile and then were even more excited to see whales breaching! Locals told us the whales had just arrived from their winter habitat and were feeding on the same fish as the gannets.,neutral,

Great looking Beach; unfortunately visiting during Hurrican Jose that brings a lot of water. Would have loved to go for a walk.,neutral,
"Ummmmm I�m confused. 5 stars compared to what? I�ve been on almost all of the Cape Cod beaches and this one is near the middle of the list, not anywhere near the top. Go to Marconi or Head of the Meadow. Breathtaking. Not this one. Unless you like o-K beaches with biting flies and RV Campers parked nearby...? LOL. 5 stars...OK.",negative,
The winter storms destroyed 2/3 of the parking. Good luck with that. This summer access will be a nightmare unless you arrive by bicycle.,negative,

Wanted to go there on a rainy day in May to take a walk on the beach. However... still 20 USD entrance fee. Absolute rip off. Not justified.,negative,
first you have to walk at lest a quarter of a mile to even get to the beach did i mention it had no covered walk way. you had to track through the sand carrying all your stuff witch sucked.

Wildwood beach may not be the largest Jersey Shore beach it�s by far the widest so there�s always plenty of space for everyone when it gets crowded during Summer season. It�s well maintained and clean and there�s a bunch of fun stuff to do at the boardwalk. One of the best beaches of the Jersey Shore!,positive,

We spend 5 days in North Wildwoods with our family. I had a shock when I first crossed the dunes at 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon. Never seen so many people at the beach in my life.

"Amazing Cape Ann beach! This was our favorite beach out of several in the area. My kids loved the waves. Very clean abc family-friendly. Arrive early in order to park ($30 weekday and $35 weekends). Only downsides - LOTS of seagulls who literally steal food out of your hands, and a parking lot that could use some attention.",positive,
"Came here in the fall just to walk around and enjoy the view and I loved it! The waves were pretty big for the Atlantic Ocean and I saw people surfing. The view was amazing.

Very clean, water is clear and cool perfect for a hot summer day, fine white sand, the place is big enough to keep distance from people, nice place to have a long walk or run.\nPlenty of space for parking- parking fee is a rip off $30; no place to shower or rinse; watch out for the gulls they�ll attack your food??",positive,
"Sure, it's a nice beach, but I maybe expected more. We had to pay $35 for parking and then saw that we probably could have found street parking and walked. If you plan to swim and use the beach, it's probably good for that, but not worth the parking cost it if just passing through.",neutral,

For the past 14 years I go to Cape Cod twice a year in the off season.\nGood harbor is beautiful but all they have off season is gross and that is with a capital G , port a pottie. I nearly lost my lunch upon entering.\nA very kind lady shared her toilet paper with me.

"Great beach but the parking has become a big problem. Before, you would pay the $20 and be able to park in their lot. However, now they have made it a resident parking lot only. There is no other place to park besides this lot. Rude.",negative,
The parking was difficult and overpriced. The distance to the beach and other visitors made for an unfavorable visit.,negative,
"Public access to this beach is limited to renting a place near the beach, walking over one mile from free/cheap parking or paying $20/day at the public lot. It seems that this is one of the few sandy beaches in the area and it attracts a LOT of people. If you want to simply walk the beach, you'll have to walk over a mile just to get here.",negative,
"Unless you�re staying within walking distance, access to the beach is restricted to a paid parking lot at the rate of $25 on weekdays / $30 on weekends. Apparently the lots fill to capacity quickly too. As a recent visitor to the area who really only wanted to spend an hour or so walking on the beach, the only option we could find was a drive by, which included the lousy feeling of being stuck traffic. Disappointing.",negative,
"The beach may be clean, but it's small, crowded, and rocky. Parking was tight but there were spaces available. The rocks all over the place made it uncomfortable to walk on - based on beaches in California, Miami, Puerto Rico, and other places, I would not call this a beach worth traveling a long distance for, but if it's the closest option I'd say it's acceptable.",negative,

if you are planning to go to the beach don't go to good harbor beach!if it's a nice beach day unless you are there by 8 am you will not find parking.parking is limited to the public but there is plenty for the residence. same goes for rockport beaches! if you go to good hardbor beach and the lot is full they will tell you to go to long beach witch is nothing spectacular to say the least. if you go to to long beach and it's high tide you will be forced out of the beach cause there is a wall!besides that the water is murky and the sand is gross. but don't despair just turn around and head for wingersheek which is not too far from long beach still in gloucester and the water is perfect kinda cold but crystal clear and most important there is plenty of parking (with a 25 $ fee)....so much for ,negative,

You can see some live sand dollars, hermit crabs, and even some fish.\nThere are rocks, guards, and a small snack bar with toilets and a shower. There was also a stand selling water ice and sand toys.\nI wish I�d known about this beach when my kids were younger. It was a wonderful morning and my husband�s favorite beach since the Caribbean.",positive,
Beautiful beach for little ones. Just watch the tides. Not much room at high tide. It�s always a shame that people don�t pay attention to signs posted. No dogs allowed and the state has a large sign posted at the entrance.,positive,
I tend to avoid Wingaersheek in July and August. The road in there is long and twisty and the beach itself can be very crowded. If you can ride a bicycle in or go after 4PM you're better off. They have bathrooms and a snack bar and a capable lifeguard staff. There are lots of rocky areas to explore at low tide so kids like it. The water is warmer here than at Good Harbor because it's not dead on the ocean. Nice and warm at low tide when the heat of the sun gets to the shallower water. Actually it's nice here any time of year so consider early Fall or late Spring. I like to get as bare as possible and that's impossible in mid-summer but on warm pre and post summer days I can manage bare bosom lying down and a thong bikini walking around. I bring my own food but definitely bring water or oth,positive,

In fact, there was broken glass in some of the tidal pools! The beach was so crowded even on a week day with most of the kids back at school. We could not even see the water from our chairs because it was so so crowded and people were right on top of one another with barely anywhere to walk between people's set ups to get to the water. We had to walk way down to the end of the beach to get some space and photos without crowds in the background. That area was much nicer but too long of a walk for us to take our chairs and things down there. The water was super crowded and had an oily residue on top of ",neutral,
"Maybe this place is well worth the visit in the summer, but for a cold but sunny day in October it wasn't worth the drive from Gloucester. We were looking for a place to walk the beach, and read that this was good for that, but it really isn't. Much of the beach is marked private in one direction and then the other direction takes you more inland, rather than towards the open ocean.",neutral,
Very chilled and laid back beach. Not many waves though. Great for a good long walk and a refreshing swim in shallow water.,neutral,
"This is a beautiful beach, but for $30 to park I would expect better facilities! There was trash floating in the water. The bathrooms were so dirty, some of the toilets were plugged. Toilet paper all over the floor. Only two outdoor showers with cold water, those were also dirty. I usually come here a couple times a year but I don�t think I�ll be back!",negative,
"Parking lot was full when my family arrived around 2pm on July the 3rd. I asked if I could drop off my family at the entrance before I could turn around to find a place to park outside the beach area, the guard said no without giving any explanation. Throughout my conversation with the guard at the entrance, he was agitated and rude to us. What is the point of not letting people walk in when the parking lot is full? Even if you have to turn people back, can't you at least find some decent people to do the job? My family have been going to Wingaersheek beach 3~4 times a year for the past 10 years as the kids love the place, but we have never seen anything like this before.",negative,
"We weren't planning to spend the day and just wanted to walk the beach and take pics, but for $25 we nixed the plan and went to Jones River Salt Marshes Beach instead. If you coming in from Atlantic St. Jones Marsh is 0.2 miles before Wingaersheek Beach and there is no cost to park there. There is a big sign and you would take a right onto a dirt road about 0.1 to the parking area. This is a good alternative for those who don't want to spend $25 for parking.",negative,
"wingarsheek had the nastiest, rudest, parking attendants and i decided i would not pay $20 to be insulted. it is a beautiful beach (i have been there many times off season and tried to vist during july and was turned completely off by the parking lot attendants. i ended up at good harbor beach where the attendants were clean, respectful and friendly.",negative,

This is a nice park. The beach area is limited because the dunes make cliffs which limit the beach area. The sunsets are pretty. It is free to enter if you walk or bicycle in which is nice.,positive,
"Such a great beach. Clean and uncrowded. I love that the restrooms are centrally located and easily accessible. One of the great benefits to this beach is that there are a few trees along the edge of the parking lot, giving lovely shade to the hot sand. A resource officer made the rounds regularly and kept things under control. All in all, a great experience.",positive,
"Went with the girls for the last day of summer break. Remembered driving up here with my wife when we were students at Notre Dame many years ago. It was just as I remembered and we created new fond memories with our three little girls. Easy parking, great sand, very clean, nice facilities. Also, there was a shaved ice truck, which was a special bonus.",positive,
"Any day at the lake is a great day, but Weko Beach brings something to the table that others don�t. There is a certain atmosphere , a certain festive vibe, a certain unassuming local charm that you don�t find elsewhere. Shallow water and sand bars are great for children. As a kid, I remember thinking how cool it was when I could be so far out and still not be over my head. Grills allowed on the upper portion of the beach with places to dump the coals. Nice steep dunes are fun if want to play king of the mountain. Elevated boardwalks provide an outstanding view of Lake Michigan sunsets.",positive,
Just made a quick stop to enjoy the beautiful view of Lake Michigan. It's worth a stop and it was pretty quiet.,positive,

I grew up coming to Weko Beach in the summer. I've generally found it to be far less crowded than Indiana Dunes State Park and because of that it's usually cleaner too. The facilities are pretty decent�restrooms and snack bar. There's a little stream a short way down the beach we used to like to play in when we were kids.,neutral,
Used to be the most amazing beach but Illinois and Indiana people have overrun and ruined it. Litter everywhere. People have room but decide to sit right next to you up your ___.

Nice little health food store near Blue Mountain Bakery, 1/2 mile away, which has great cinnamon rolls but sell out by 9am! Excellent ice cream, shakes and snow cones by Blue Mountain Creamery 1.5 miles down the road, easy biking on the trail. 30A does get busy, and there is no bike rail that gets you all the way to Publix.

"Here is a PSA about culture on the beach in general and Santa Rosa Beach in particular (the beach itself is absolutely perfect, btw!) What makes any beach less enjoyable is some people who think that everyone around them enjoys the same type of music as they do or want to listen to ANY music at the beach at all. Some of the lowest of the low in a cultural pyramid are those who bring their portable speakers to a crowded beach. Sadly, you will most likely be around such people at Santa Rosa Beach. They really dampen the experience for the rest of us who want to enjoy the sounds of the ocean and kids playing - not some country-whining and/or base-laden nonsense. Sadly, I realize that this review will not make a difference except letting me vent a bit. But just on an off chance that you are on",positive,
Love the beaches on 30A. Parking is an issue if you are using public access. This requires some advance planning for sure.,positive,
"We took the stairs down at the San Juan entrance as it had parking for our golf cart. We were able to carry our two chairs, umbrella and cooler in one trip.

Sandy white beaches!!! Clean and free of trash these beaches are always an amazing experience. The water is gorgeous and often times you have nice sand bars that allow you to go out further. This time around we had many manta rays swimming around which adds to the beauty. A must see!,positive,
"We visited the Seagrove area beaches. The beaches are beautiful and feel tropical, too bad they are so loud and crowded with limited access even if you are staying right by the beach. If you are visiting the area or renting for a week, double check your rental agreements of which beaches you have access to and the walking/biking distance to those beaches. Very few have parking access and the state park beaches that do have parking are often filled very early in the morning. Lots of chair/umbrella companies set up along the beach and take up prime spots, making it difficult to sit right in front of the water. Recommendation to go to the beach early to get a decent spot.",neutral,
"The beach is gorgeous: incredible white powdery sand, nice landscaping with low buildings and miles and miles of beaches to enjoy (when that's possible). We visited this beach from October 6th to October 8th (when we had to leave due to Hurricane Michael) and red tide was horrible. You could only stay at the beach (or near it) very early in the morning to avoid coughing; then, when the wind direction changed, it all started again: cough, runny nose, scratchy throats and hundreds of dead fish on the sand: what a terrible pity!!! A pity, yes, for visitors, for the fauna, for locals!!!! I know red tide is supposed to be a natural phenomenon, but is it really so??? Can't there be some other human-made factor boosting it???

Basically, private property beaches can now enforce no trespassing. The signs are everywhere. You can still use wet sand but nothing else if it�s marked private. Our space on the beach this year was reduced by 75%. We will go someplace else until FL fixes this. 12th year coming, such a shame.",neutral,

By the time we returned to our car the second was full and there were cars parked along the road as we left for quite a long way.",positive,
The views are amazing. The tallest seaside cliffs in the world. A refreshing change from the more arid south and west shores.,positive,

The views were breath taking and Drew was an incredible guide! So happy to have shared his company while exploring the na pali coast. 10/10!,positive,
Yes it�s beautiful but also some things you need to know. The road down is one lane and tough to drive at times. The biggest thing is the road can be impassable after rain. We drove all the way down and then had to back up a one lane to turn around because the road was flooded. It was terrible as it�s impossible to turn around because the road is so narrow.,neutral,

"We visited this beach while traveling through Big Sur three years ago and it was windy. We went through Big Sur again last month on our way to Monterey and it was windy again when it was NOT windy elsewhere. After paying to park to visit this beach, we are inclined to NOT visit it again. We were very disappointed. There are pretty rocks to view with the waves crashing through them, but the beach is very short and not good for a hike. Our first time was in the summer and now this visit was the winter. We are thinking that maybe it is just always windy here due to the location.",neutral,
"Nice road tr but a bit long and quite foggy, sometimes the road is a bit scary to be honest, but the view is impressive",neutral,
"It's ridiculous that they charge $12 to park. AND they had such flooding right before the gate, that there was a jam up of cars, as some of them didn't want to try going through the flooded canal. I saw a ranger pick the front end of a car that was in the flooded area. $5 parking fee would be reasonable.",negative,
"I did not get to see the beach when I tried on a Saturday when driving from ragged point to Monterey bay. I was turned back because the park is full but this review is about how difficult and perhaps dangerous entering the park from HW1. First it is a very sharp turn with no easy way to see any car coming out when you turn into the park entrance. Second it is a steep decline going down after the turn. So for someone not familiar with driving on a slope, this is not a comfortable place to visit. Getting out is almost as bad if multiple cars got trapped on the way up the slope. And why the CA rangers cannot set up a lot full sign before cars getting down the slope from HW1 is beyond me? They may think it is fun going up and down the slope.",negative,
"We went here hoping to see purple sand, but in reality there is very little of it. We were disappointed to see that because there was so little purple sand it looked more dirty than pretty. We did not go right after the rain so maybe we would have seen more in other circumstances, but for the long wait to get into the parking lot and the high winds that whipped our faces, we didn't find this beach worth it.",negative,
"We had just left Julia Pheiffer park thinking we could have beach access and found out we couldn't. Off to Pheiffer Beach to find the beach! We waiting in a line of cars for about 10 minutes only to find out the beach access was NOT easily accessible. The Ranger told us it was about a 2 mile walk to the beach. What?! Reviews on TA said it was easy access to the beach from the parking lot. Unreal...we spent most of the day trying to find a beach and were striking out. So I would have liked to see the purple sand beaches and big rock formations to report to other travelers, but we weren't ready to drag all of our beach gear two miles.",negative,
"Thought we'd try a Friday visit because we'd heard weekends were crowded. Apparently so are weekdays in summer. Took us 3 passes down Highway 1 to find the entrance. Then we were turned away because the lot was full (about 1pm). We turned around and stopped to check our map, only to have the security guard yell at us for blocking traffic! I just needed a minute to figure out our next stop. No cell signal, BTW. Make sure you have a paper map!",negative,
"This is a beautiful beach and worth the 1 to 2 mile twisty single lane road to get there. It was sunny on the day we went there but in the past has been very windy so I recommend preparing for both. Might also be helpful to brush up on your DMV handbook about who has the right of way on a single lane road (answer: uphill driver). Not that it matters, people were very courteous in both directions I was very impressed.",positive,
"Its a tough find, but once you are on the road, its easy to navigate down. Once you get to the beach, it's unreal! The rocks in the water and the waves hitting them are very powerful. But the peaceful beach just make it so calming. The purple sand is the top layer, but if you are lucky to get after a rain, it really pops! Really enjoyed the time we had here!",positive,
Very much an intsa location! Waterfall tumbling to a sandy beach. Never seen anything like it elsewhere.,positive,
Gorgeous beach and surf. Purple sand. Dogs on leash are permitted on beach. Definitely worth stopping to explore when in the Big Sur area.,positive,

"One of the world�s top beaches! We were in Maui for 2 weeks over Xmas, and we spent maybe 8 total days at this beach! You just have to be so very careful to stay out of the �crash zone� of the waves - since due to the steepness of the sand they often crash in very shallow water. So you can get really hurt by lingering too shallow. They call it �break-neck beach� for a reason. Separately, it astonishes me that people are paying for parking. We parked across the street every single day and saved ourselves literally $30 a day or a total of $240. Not bad work for maybe 5 minutes walk each way?",positive,

If I was rating it on going in the water it would be a 1 star. Terrible. This beach is nick naked Break Neck beach for a reason. Many necks (and numerous other bones) have been broken just feet from the shore. Not to mention the fact that this is also considered one of the most dangerous beaches for Shark attacks (google it.

Love Cherry Grove Beach my wife and I go to beach. Great place to stay! It�s a little bit quieter than Myrtle Beach area.And less congested traffic. We love to go out on the pier. Also a wonderful place to look for shells.,positive,
Beach was very clean and easy to get to from our room. Also enjoyed the pier. Definitely worth going back to.,positive,
"The beach itself is wide and level, but parking is problematic. Go early and avoid weekends if possible. There are a few places to get food and beverages and portable toilets.",positive,
"Nice beach, a bit rocky. Sunset beach not far from this one is much nicer. Very enjoyable though for a touristy spot.",positive,
"I stayed here about 10 years ago and found it very nice. A little out of the way for N Myrtle attractions, but also a bit quieter. It was nice walking on the beach back then. However, in the intervening years it appears to have had significant beach erosion due to the frequency of hurricanes that have passed over. At high tide, there was almost no beach remaining in some spots. I definitely would not take my kids/grandkids there to spend a week, given the beach situation. BUT - it's very quiet and nice to walk on.",neutral,
Great location but the bait seems very expensive. Everyone is nice and friendly so try it but be prepared to pay for that bait.,neutral,
"Pretty average beach for us. Very crowded the week we were there. Water was brown all week which was nasty. Overall, pretty clean sand and plenty of space.",neutral,
We thought we'd venture out and explore the other beaches in the area while we were staying in N. Myrtle Beach. We decided to go down to Cherry Grove. It's a quiet little beach town with a pier. We had to pay $3 just to walk the pier.,neutral,
"This may seem odd to say about a beach, but there were too many broken sea shells along the shore that actually hurt my little girls feet when she tried to get her feet wet. Other then that the beach was very clean. We saw no trash and all umbrellas were neatly placed. My kids really enjoyed the water/sand.",neutral,
It is very far away from south myrtle beach were the skywheel is located. It seems like a more relaxed place but was not what we were looking for from traveling 20 miles each night from attractions.,neutral,
"I was able to walk on the beach a few times this balmy February. Lots of access points, so easy to tailor how far you want to walk.",neutral,
What a rude encounter with two of the lifeguards next to Cherry Grove Pier! We couldn�t believe they made dismissive comments and blew us off when we asked about the water conditions!,negative,
"First visit stopped in for a late dinner. Place is clean, service was good. We ordered Banging shrimp for our appetizer. Frozen fried shrimp with hot sauce????. For our main course, fish tacos an a burger an fries. The burger was paper thin an cooked black it was so hard my husband could not eat it. He sent it back. They gave us credi. The fish tacos were just okay nothing impressive about their food at all.",negative,
Not a good first-impression. The local amenities may be great but the local renters (owners?) did NOT convey a family-oriented type of location. Lack of law-enforcement further solidified the impression that this is more-of a party-location. We did not have a totally quiet and relaxing time.,negative,
"That beach is just at the end of the beautiful Grand Strand-many miles from Myrtle Beach-and not close to all the attractions that you go to the beach to see!! Nothing there, so I'd opt for being much closer to Myrtle where so many things are available!",negative,
"No need to go here. The staff at the bait shop were rude, beach is marginal at best. All amenities for resort guests only. Much better options available.",negative,
"Get rid of all the half naked drunken college kids, and teach the locals a few manners. This was perhaps the worst resort town I've ever visited.",negative,
"We visited many beaches and Poipu was by far the best to snorkel and swim. Wear swim shoes to get past the rocks at the entrance, but then so many beautiful fish can be seen! You may also see Sea turtles and monk seals resting on the shore during the day, carefully watched over by volunteers who set up the ropes and signs to protect them. We stayed at a Suite Paradise condo and could walk to the beach from there. What a treat!",positive,
Very large beach area with good restrooms. This is a. Ery busy beach though so get there early for a decent parking spot and location. There were two sea turtles beached on the sand that we got to see make there way to the sea. Plenty of restaurants and shaved ice nearby.,positive,
" Go early in the morning to see the turtles. On overcast days they are there for longer (on an overcast morning they were out until around 8:30am). At dusk, there were also � WhiThe titles says it all. Decent swimming (a few rocks to worry about) and not to rough. Great home base Beach for our stay.le there were a lot of people, there was ample space for everyone and didn't feel crowded. You can also probably see monk seals there as well�either sleeping on shore, or playing around in the water.turtles within the waves.",positive,
"This was our first time snorkeling at Poipu Beach. There were lots of fish which was great. However it's very shallow and I got some cuts from the coral. As a bonus, there was a turtle on the beach that was fun to watch.",positive,
"Relatively crowded but not overly so (mid-afternoon, midweek). While we were there, two monk seals came right up onto the beach! The lifeguard had to keep warning people that they were wild animals. So cool to see!",positive,
"This is a lovely beach. It is very crowded and busy though. After sunset however, green seat turtles come ashore and hangout. So cool to get to see them upclose.",positive,
"It seemed this beach was not as natural as the others on the island. For sure more people and reminded me of a beach in the states. Maybe because of all the grassy area before the beach. There were two turtles sleeping, which was neat to see.",neutral,
"Its a decent beach, its very crowded. We did see the monk sea basking on the beach and some turtles in the water. Its okay, but nothing special here.",neutral,
"We went a little too early in the season and the oceans were pretty rough. Check the Kaui page for ocean conditions. A lot of tourists get in trouble because they don't. If the ocean is pretty rough then Poipu is a safe beach as it has a rocky break halfway around. It's really good for families and kids. The lifeguards are VERY attentive. If you like to snorkel there are a few fish and some fun things to see but if the other beaches are open I would not snorkel here. Very popular beach lots of people, a resort feel. If you've been to beach bathrooms used by lots of people you know what to expect. We will return later in the season next time and probably won't use this beach... but we snorkel and scuba so are looking for other features.",neutral,
Check it out first for snorkeling. There is just one less-rocky place to enter the water for snorkeling. But there are sea turrles hanging around at a big rock not far out.,neutral,
Nice enough beach but way too crowded for me. Not as pretty as many other beaches but it appears to be a good place to snorkel. Not too deep and well protected little Bay Area.,neutral,
"Highly over rated, too many people, too many people snorkeling that have no idea what they are doing. If you want a quiet beach or a good snorkeling beach drive around a fund a place to have your solitude.",neutral,
"After having spent the first half of our trip on the more isolated North Shore (as a result of the restricted access via the Kuhio Highway), Poipu Beach was a let-down. Perhaps if it had been our first stop, we would have been more pleased. The area is made up of small coves with limited and steep beaches against a backdrop of corporate resorts.",neutral,
"We have been to Poipu beach twice. Both times it was very crowded and dirty. If you go, bring some shade, there is not much shade to be had here. Good for snorkeling if you don�t mind the crowds. There are restrooms with changing rooms that are relatively clean considering the amount of use. We heard about Anini beach on the North Shore, and liked it much better.",negative,
"It�s beautiful, of course. It�s a Hawaiian beach after all. But the shallows are very rocky, paved with roughly 8� or so diameter rocks which are quite slippery too. August unfortunately brings stronger currents than usual and even in the shallows, my husband got dragged a bit, and he is a strong swimmer.",negative,
"We couldn't even find a place to park, but the whole area was so jammed with people, it wasn't a spot that we would have enjoyed, anyway.",negative,
"There are far better, more beautiful, and less crowded beaches on Kauai. This is probably the most popular beach on the island with visitors - but is not the best one. Unless you want to share the beach with hundreds of mainlanders, ask locals for less touristy beaches",negative,
"Trusted Travel Guide, absolutely overated and overcrowded beach. For this one should not visit Kaui or Hawaii. There are better beaches up north and on Hawaii. Leave the beach to the poor animals! Best was the nearby historic site parc!",negative,
"Nothing much to see, even at Lawai and waters were pretty rough even in winter, so not worth the drive.",negative,
Lagoons were crystal clear and warmer than the ocean water. We had seals come in at the Aulani resort. Few locals and mostly resort guests. great views.,positive,
"Very nice place, away from crowds, calm waters. Really enjoyed spending time here with family on a nice sunny day. Must visit in my opinion.",positive,
Excellent Condition-Four Seasons Resort shares this Lagoon and offers its excellent service for its guest on the lagoon. Only negative is during times the public try�s to use private property of Four Seasons Resort- nuisance.,positive,
"If I tell you, you might come and then it won't be our special secret place to come! We usually do the hike up Diamond Head then drive over here, park free at the public lagoon parking and then swim, snorkel, walk along the pathway and enjoy a few hours relaxing. We always see military planes doing fly overs and it is fun to count how many we will see. Snorkelling in the lagoons is great and safe for kids as it is protected. We often see Turtle or Honu as the locals call them.",positive,
"Solid lagoons, has an area that is grassed (put your towels there the grass is comfortable) as well as a sand area. Decent snorkeling if you get a lagoon that is not too cloudy.",positive,
"My husband and I visited lagoon # 2, which was beautiful, with clear, calm water and a sandy beach. Great area for swimming and for families with kids. I snorkeled here and there were a few fish to see, but it wasn't as good as other areas on the island. Parking can be difficult to find. Not too far from Waikiki. There are restrooms here.",positive,
"These artificial lagoons are interesting; they are protected from the ocean waves by artificial breakwaters, giving the sense of being in the ocean, yet not encounter dangerous rip tides, etc.",neutral,
"This area must have been all rock, which was blasted out to create 4 lagoons and beaches. The lagoons offer protection from the waves and larger sea life, and the sandy bottom is very friendly to your feet. I, however, prefer to have a lot of coral and sea life to view while snorkeling; there is none of that in these lagoons. Therefore, think of the lagoons as large, sandy swimming pools.",neutral,
"I'm giving Ko Olina Lagoons three stars because umbrellas and any sort of shade tents are banned. Like come on now, in this day of increased skin cancer and sun awareness to not allow umbrellas is ridiculous. The yellow-shirted Ko Olina employee patrolling the grounds said it's for 'liability' reasons, but really now, let people have some shade. Baking in the direct sun all day is not enjoyable for many people, small children included.\nWent to Lagoon 2, as though I've spent tons of time on Oahu I have never been to Ko Olina. It was literally the only not stormy and rainy spot on the island so we decided to check it out. The lagoons and beaches are quite nice for swimming and we also brought our snorkel gear and I was pleasantly surprised as it was a lot better than I thought. I don't know",neutral,

"The lagoons are okay, but they are SUPER crowded with tourists from the resorts who have little to no respect for the environment. They leave their trash instead of taking it with them. The kids are running everywhere unsupervised. The area is beautiful, but I would rather go to one of the areas away from the resort to enjoy a less crowded beach.",neutral,
"The resort lagoons are nice for a family swim or just to walk along. If you are not staying at any of the resorts, there is free parking at each of the lagoons. The first three lagoons have limited parking (maybe 15-20 spots) however the fourth lagoon has lots of parking so I would just head there first. A couple of the beaches have umbrellas up from the different resorts. Beaches in Hawaii are all public so you can also use the beach even if you are not staying at their resorts...and if you have your own umbrella, that is ok as well as it is public property. At some of the resorts, there is drink and snack bars that you can purchase things from...they are along the lagoons pathway so you don't need to go into a resort to get anything. The snorkeling in the bays would be limited as there i",negative,
"Ecoli was found this week, sure kept me out Of the lagoon, lots of pools,and I love the lap pool at my resort.",negative,
"We recently arrived in Ko Olina and have observed available parking spaces in the lots at the lagoons at 9am and yet the (surprise to us) gate was closed -\nHave been coming to beautiful Ko Olina for 10 years and there has never been a problem parking if you get there early - very frustrating to see spaces and can't get into the lot! These gates are not working properly!\nWhen we finally got into one of the lagoons and left in the afternoon, there were 8 spaces available and yet the entrance gate was closed...\nWe are here for the month of April - now to find that even getting to the lagoons early will keep you from enjoying the beach - we are paying a lot of money to stay in beautiful Ko Olina and will now be frustrated for the month to go to the lagoons... Please fix or remove the gates!",negative,
Use to be better. Now the little parking for people to visit these has become pay parking. Overcrowded and water not exchanged that well. I'm sure this could be a bacteria heaven. Thought all beaches in Hawaii were public. Guess if you build it then they aren't. All ko'olina is expensive. May as well go to Waikiki and pay through the nose as here.,negative,
In Hawaii we like the crystal clear waters and these man-made lagoons seem a bit stagnant and murky.\nwe chose to walk down the street to secret beach so we could have a real and beautiful beach to sekm and snorkel,negative,
"It was extremely underwhelming, I wanted to come here on my last hawaii trip but no time. Came here this time and the entire area is just a golf course, 4 kiddie pools, a few hotels and some timeshares. Well Whoopi do da.. I mean it�s a well manicured area and such but also kind of has that nose turned up feeling. Oh well, I�ll stick with Kauai, Maui and north shore Oahu.",neutral,
"Pensacola has great food, beautiful beaches, and plenty to explore beyond the beach. We enjoyed our weekend trip and look forward to heading back soon.",positive,
"Easy parking (free), and easy access to beach. Sand is white and water is clear. Price of renting 2 chairs and umbrella, $25.00 for 2 hrs., $50.00 for day, is a bit high. Bayside $30.00 for day. No dog beach, but you have those who don't follow the rules! Plenty of restaurants facing the beach with good food and drinks when your ready.",positive,
"Check in was easy, even given a military discount I did not expect. King room with Bayside view and balcony. Early check in granted. Room was large with king bed and small kurig with supplies. Free wifi. No smart tv so stuck watching local channels. No comforters, just a light blanket. No digital thermostat so had to guess on settings so either too hot or too cold.. No room service due to covid but texted to get clean towels, etc. Bathroom had large walk in shower but no permanent shower head, just sprayer that you had to hold to use as was at an awkward angle to shower under. The sink was pretty but not practical for rinsing anything out in. No microwave to heat up leftovers, did have a dorm size refrigerator. Staff very friendly and attentive. Land Shark Landing was closed during our sta",positive,
"Was expecting the clear emerald waters but got a wave filled amber ocean..it was beautiful either way we had rip tide warnings which is why the water is very angry..The sand was powdery white sand..

"The best part of pensacola was the water. The beaches in and around pensacola truly have white sand and the most beautiful blue-green water. I have not see water so pretty! However, pensacola seemed to be a bit small for the amount of tourism it gets. It was so hard to find a place to eat because most were full with long lines and 1 hour + wait times. The parking was difficult at times. Crabs, Flounders, and Peg leg Pete's were great restaurants with great service. Downtown is cute but there is not much to do besides tour museums and go to bars. It was a nice trip but we had so many problems between finding bathrooms, food, and things to do. A plus was we didn't see any bugs like bees or pesky mosquitos. So many cute lizards though. You can also find a ton of quiet secluded beach spaces.",neutral,
"We have not been to the beach in years. I guess now after Covid everyone is coming out of the woodwork and fails to respect others around. It seemed that everyone had to play their music louder than the person next to them.\nAlso, I never understand why you have to pay to visit any piers in Florida, maybe ask for donations or charge people who want to stay on it for the whole day like fishing, It was over $2 per person to walk on it, I know that doesn't sound like a lot but if you have 4 family members and walk up and down you close to burning $10.\nI saw clean-up crews working hard to keep the beach clean and the trash can empty. Also if you have smaller kids there are parts of the beach where people are not supposed to bring alcohol, We saw some drunks in our area and it wasn't even late",neutral,

"Pensacola Beach is beautiful! I loved the time I spent there. However be aware that from November 1 to February 28 you cannot rent beach chairs, umbrellas, towels, etc due to it being �off season.� My hotel (Hilton) assured me that those items were available, but no they were not.
